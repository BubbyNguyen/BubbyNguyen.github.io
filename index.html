    <p> As an engineering student, I have always had a passion and admiration for great design, creation, and implementation
    of new technologies. Thus, my obsession with the latest and greatest has pushed me to try creating things of my own.
    On my spare time, I enjoy tinkering with arduinos, learning new languages, and conceptualizing technological solutions
    to my everyday problems. I'm a firm believer that the implemetation of technology can bring society to a more innovative era
    and as an aspiring engineer, I would love to be apart of that. Aside from engineering, I also have a great interest in
    fashion. I believe that it is a form of art that allows everyone to become living canvases that show expressions of themselves.   </p>
